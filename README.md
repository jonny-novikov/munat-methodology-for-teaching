# A methodology for fully-immersive, just-in-time learning

A synopsis of the methodology I've been developing for 25 years or so and discussing in various presentations. Hope to publish a book by the end of this year. In the meantime, this is a basic reference.

This methodology is _declarative_, not imperative. It describes _what_ we need to do, but not _how_ to do it. The how will be determined empirically&mdash;by experimentation and iteration in an agile fashion.

## Eight Techniques

1. Learn **just in time**, not just in case
    * Learn only what you need to know exactly when you need to know it and apply it immediately and repeatedly. Avoid the rabbit holes.
1. Learn **inductively** not deductively
    * Begin with concrete examples, then abstract the principles, not the other way around. Stay as low on the tree of abstraction as you can. (Principle of least power.)
1. Learn **outside-in**
    * Begin with the context and framework so you know where you are going, then fill in the detail. (Don’t start with details and then wrap it into a framework at the end.)
1. Learn **front-to-back**
    * Learn what you’ll need to know next first (i.e., the next version), then back up to where you need to be now and no further. Tomorrow’s skills will have the longest shelf-life; yesterday’s skills have expired already.
1. Keep it **real**
    * Do real work for real people using real tools. Sandboxes, toy applications, and busywork are a waste of time and effort.
1. Favour **skills over knowledge**
    * Skills require mentoring and practice, and practice makes permanent. Do it right the first time and every time. Knowledge is perishable and volatile and can be acquired instantly and the moment it is needed. (Thank you, Google.)
    * Einstein: Never memorise anything that’s already written down.
1. Follow the **single, shortest path**
    * Pick one good way to do the thing and stick to it. Providing alternatives early on only confuses and increases cognitive load. There will be time to learn other approaches later. Finish learning one thing before you move to another.
1. **Always be learning**
    * Never stand still for long. Learn at every available opportunity. Look continually for opportunities to learn, but remember to focus your learning on relevant material: what you need&mdash;just-in-time&mdash;to do what you need to do _now_.

## Seven Principles

1. Stay **student-centered**
    * Too often we make decisions based on what’s easiest or cheapest for the institution or the instructors in the short term. Making learning most effective for the student provides much better ROI in the longer term.
1. Cultivate **autonomy**
    * The true task of teachers is to teach the student how to learn. Progressive autonomy is the goal. Initially, plenty of structure and direction, but shifting as quickly as practicable to fully self-directed learning. The self-directed learner is the mature learner.
1. **Make it to measure**
    * One size fits hardly anyone. Every student is unique and needs a bespoke pedagogy and curriculum for the greatest learning efficacy.
1. **Surface the pedagogy**
    * Most important is to help the learner learn how to learn. To this end, teach not only the material, but the pedagogy used to teach it at every opportunity&mdash;just in time.
1. Favour **teachers over domain experts**
    * Teaching is both an art and a science; it is a profession. You wouldn’t ask your chef to be your surgeon&mdash;why ask your domain expert to be your teacher?
1. Stay **agile**
    * Both learning and learning to learn are iterative, incremental processes. Adapt quickly. Experiment and “fail fast”. If it isn’t working, try something else.
1. Take a **holiatric approach**
    * Holiatry is a medical term meaning “care of the entire patient in all aspects of well-being, including physical, psychological, and social". When creating a program for learning, consider everything. A very partial list of questions we should be asking (and answering and then applying what we've _learned_) follows.
      * Environment
          * What is the best temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, ionization, air flow for learning? Does it vary?
          * Should lighting be diffuse or direct? Warm or cool? Bright or dim? Coloured? Intermittent or steady?
          * Should our visuals be cluttered or clean? Closed or open and spacious? Artificial or natural? What about the view? Trees? Ocean? Skyline? Brick wall?
          * What is the best room geometry? Room size? Ceiling height? Should we be indoors or outdoors? How should we position ourselves both in the room and relative to each other? One big room or many small rooms?
          * How ergonomic should our desks, displays, seating, etc. be? What about traffic patterns? Access to facilities? The kitchen? The loo? The library?
          * Should there be background sound? Noise, music, or something else? How loud? How often? What about speech? How do our speech patterns, tone, volume, etc. affect learning?
          * How does our tactile sense affect learning? Coarse or smooth surfaces? Warm or cool to the touch? Natural or artificial materials?
          * How do aromas affect learning? Can we use our olfactory sense to enhance memory? Can information be conveyed by scent? Does it matter whether the odours in our environment are pleasant or unpleasant? Which improves learning?
      * Physiological
          * What time should we go to bed? How long should we sleep? How firm should the mattress be? What materials should we come into contact with? Should we sleep clothed or naked? What temperature/humidity should the room be? How about air movement? Sound? How does white noise affect memory processing? What about repetitive noise, such as waves?
          * How much should we eat? When? How? How quickly or slowly? Does how much we chew affect learning? Should we favour carbs, protein, or fat? Which nutrients are best and in what amounts?
          * How frequently should we exercise? For what duration? With what intensity? What types of movements and in what patterns?
          * How does the brain learn? Does the body learn differently? How does age affect us? What role does fatigue play? Can sex improve learning? What about cuddling? Are there drugs that can help us to learn better or faster? What are the side effects?
      * Social
          * Do we learn better in heterogenous or homogeneous groups? Is this affected by the topic? Are hierarchies better, or should we provide a more egalitarian or even anarchic arrangement?
          * Should we learn as individuals? Teams? In pairs? With same group or regularly changing groups or partners? In different groups at different times?
          * Should the teacher be a servant? A master? A peer? A friend? A formal professional? A lover? How do our relationships affect our learning?
      * Psychological
          * What is the relationship between stress and learning? How much is too much? Too little?
          * How do emotions affect learning? Which emotions improve learning? Which interfere?
          * How can we apply mnemonics, gamification, learning preferences, etc. to maximise learning?
          * What is the semiotics of learning? Is there such a thing?

The questions are endless. Even if we have answered many of these, how many do we take into account when we learn or when we set up a training program or school? We have a lot of ideas and theories, and perhaps even some evidence, but very little to show for it.
